* org-jira mode

Use [[http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview/][Jira]] in Emacs org-mode.

To save the settings in your .emacs, you need only do 2 things:

1. Set the ~defcustom~ variables defined in jiralib.el (actually only
   the =jiralib-url= is required, as the other 2 are usually computed
   from it correctly and is the case in the video demo):

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    3 matches for "\bdefcustom\b" in buffer: jiralib.el
         55:(defcustom jiralib-host ""
        120:(defcustom jiralib-url
    #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Write your password in =~/.authinfo=, with machine being the
   (computed) jiralib-host, and the port being 80 (even if you are
   using https for Jira):

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   machine JIRALIB-HOST login USERNAME password XXXXX port 80
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   If you do not set USERNAME here, then it will be prompted using the
   minibuffer; if you set the wrong username/password, then it won't work.

** Configuration



** Commands supported

Here is the list of commands supported by org-jira, with a simple help
(the first line of elisp doc). It is created with *C-h a org-jira
RET* :-)

You can *C-h f* on each command to get more detailed help, or just
read my ugly source code:-)
